### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick StÃ¶ckle, I am almost finished with my Ph.D. in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/), and currently looking for a job.
As a researcher in IT security and software engineering, I have published several articles as a first author, notably two A* papers.
During my time at the TUM, I worked 4 years on an industry-funded project about security configuration.
Furthermore, I was for 4 years the leading teaching assistant for the course Security Engineering.
Thus, I have profound knowledge of IT security from an industrial and academic perspective.
As a programmer, I have more than 10 years of programming experience in different languages.
Furthermore, I can offer excellent software engineering and team collaboration skills.
