### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dr. Patrick StÃ¶ckle and in my job as an expert for cloud and container security at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), I help people to use these technologies securely, and develop tools and approaches to support them in doing so.

I received [my PhD](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/?id=1720520) in computer science from the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) in 2024.
As a researcher at the [chair of software and systems engineering](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/), I have published several articles as a first author, notably two A* papers and worked 4 years on an industry-funded project about [security configuration](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/forschung/hardening-security-configuration/).
Furthermore, I was for 4 years (2019 â€“ 2022) the leading teaching assistant for the course [Security Engineering](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=460596).
Thus, I have profound knowledge of IT security from an industrial and academic perspective.
Before that I did my bachelor' and master's degree at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) with a strong focus on IT Security, Software Engineering, and Mathematics.

As a programmer, I have more than 10 years of programming experience in different languages.
I started with Java in my bachelor's and master's degree, then switched to Python for my PhD, and now I am working a lot with [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) and the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) for my job.
Furthermore, I can offer excellent software engineering and team collaboration skills.
