### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick StÃ¶ckle and I am almost finished with my Ph.D. in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).
In my job as expert for cloud and container security at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), I help people to use these technologies securely, and develop tools and approaches to support them in doing so.
As a researcher in IT security and software engineering, I have published several articles as a first author, notably two A* papers.
During my time at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I worked 4 years on an industry-funded project about security configuration.
Furthermore, I was for 4 years (2019 â€“ 2022) the leading teaching assistant for the course Security Engineering.
Thus, I have profound knowledge of IT security from an industrial and academic perspective.
Before that I did my bachelor' and master's degree at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) with a strong focus on IT Security, Software Engineering, and Mathematics.
As a programmer, I have more than 10 years of programming experience in different languages.
Furthermore, I can offer excellent software engineering and team collaboration skills.
